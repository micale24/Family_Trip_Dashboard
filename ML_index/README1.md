## Background

Let's plan a post Covid family getaway to Disney Land's Animal Kingdom!  This web application will allow the customer to plan a trip to Animal Kingdom by providing wait times to specific rides at the Safari Park.  With customer's input, we shall predict a wait times based on data from previous years.  

## Skills Used

We used metadata set from [Touring Plans](https://www.touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar/#DataSets) 
* Extracted a CSV
   * Loaded into Juypter Notebook
        Cleaned dataset with Python and
        Machine Learning to predict wait times
        converted back into a CSV
   * Converted ML CSV into JSON
   * Loaded JSON onto Web Site with HTML,CSS, Java Script 

## The Story

The dilemma of not being able to travel with friends and family for vacation to Disney Land.  The customer selects a date receives the average wait times of three rides in Safari Park.
